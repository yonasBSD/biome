index.ts:7:5 lint/nursery/noFloatingPromises ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  i A "floating" Promise was found, meaning it is not properly handled and could lead to ignored errors or unexpected behavior.
  
    5 │ function test() {
    6 │     // Invalid: Promise is not handled (no await, no .then, no void operator)
  > 7 │     getValue();
      │     ^^^^^^^^^^^
    8 │ }
    9 │ 
  
  i This happens when a Promise is not awaited, lacks a `.catch` or `.then` rejection handler, or is not explicitly ignored using the `void` operator.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
