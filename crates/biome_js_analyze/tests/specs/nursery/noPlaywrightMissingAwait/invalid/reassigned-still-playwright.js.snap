  i Async matchers return a Promise that must be handled.
  
  i Add await before the expression or return it from the function.
  
  i This rule belongs to the nursery group, which means it is not yet stable and may change in the future. Visit https://biomejs.dev/linter/#nursery for more information.
  
  i Unsafe fix: Add await before the call.
